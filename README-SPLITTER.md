### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Calculate the correct tip and total cost of the bill per person

## My process

I began by creating the HTML and adding the CSS. To figure out the javascript I had to borrow from some friends and get some help, but it was a lot easier to figure out with an html file that wasn't styled. After I completed the project I wished that I had made less spatial decisions using pixels and used more responsive increments. 

### What I learned

I learned a great deal from this excercise, such as how to add the svg files such as $ to the left side of the input. But mostly it was a great opportunity to look for and create details from the design examples given.

### Continued development

I will continue to develop my ability to create functional, responsive, and interactive programs. The biggest area of focus that I gained from this is to focus more specifically on responsive spatial incrementation.
